Reviewer 2:

Programmer,

The code runs properly for the Tea Selection portion of the application. The only thing I could say to improve would be the tab names - they appear as "Camera" and "Photos", although the "Camera" tab brings up the Tea Selection and the "Photos" tab brings up a blank white screen. Also, the font on the Tea selection part is always white so if you click on a lighter shade of tea you can't read the font, but on the darker shades you can. 

Titanium recognized a few errors on the camera gadget code such as missing semicolons, but even after fixing the errors the camera gadget still doesn't run. When referncing the camera gadget code in the Titanium Appcelerator book on page 154-155, the code here looks identical. Overall, the code seems to be written correctly and the problems may lie in my emulator.
